# Smoke Beefs

Smoke Beefs is a research project by students of Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiyyah Purwokerto Islamic Integrated High School. In this research, prototypes of measuring device and Android application were made for monitoring the weight and size of cows. Smoke Beefs won a bronze medal in the Indonesian Student Research Competition in Informatics Engineering.

This repository contains a Python code that runs on Raspberry Pi and an Arduino code that runs on Arduino Uno. The Python code is used to communicate with Arduino Uno, take photo of the cow, read QR code, detect the cow, estimate the size of the cow, and send data to Firebase. The Arduino code is used to control the gates and the scale in the devices.
